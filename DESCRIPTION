Description: This packages provides a small simulated RNASeq data 
    which contains the Salmon quantified counts (with inferential replicates)
    and tree file obtained from TreeTerminus. The quantification counts were
    obtained for 12 simulated samples, generated through Polyester, with
    samples belonging to two conditions, 6 in each. For each RNA-Seq sample,
    100 gibbs samples have been generated generated. The Cons mode was used
    for obtaining the final forest of trees from TreeTerminus.
